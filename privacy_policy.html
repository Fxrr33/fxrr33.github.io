Google account and user data
Accessing user data

The applications access Google resources from your local machine or web. Your machine communicates directly with the Google APIs.
The AskReddit bot project never receives your data or the permission to access your data. The owners of the project can only see anonymous,
aggregated information about usage of tokens obtained through its OAuth client, such as which APIs and endpoints are being used.
The package includes functions that you can execute in order to read or modify your own data. This can only happen after you provide a token,
which requires that you authenticate yourself as a specific Google user and authorize these actions.
The package can help you get a token by guiding you through the OAuth flow in the browser.
There you must consent to allow the AskReddit bot Packages to operate on your behalf. The OAuth consent screen will describe the scope of what is being authorized,
e.g.,it will name the target API(s) and whether you are authorizing “read only” or “read and write” access.
There are two ways to use these apps without authorizing the inkaverse API Packages: bring your own service account token or configure the package to use an OAuth client of your choice.

Overview of the scopes requested by various AskReddit bot and their rationale:

 Sharing user data

	The package only communicate with Google APIs. No user data is shared with the owners of the AskReddit bot or any other servers.
	Storing user data

The package may store your credentials on your local machine, for later reuse by you. Use caution when using these packages on a shared machine.
